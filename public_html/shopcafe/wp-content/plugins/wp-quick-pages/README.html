wp-quick-pages
==============

WordPress plugin that lets you quickly create blank pages with hierarchies.  Useful if you use WordPress as a CMS for simple sites that make use of pages.

This plugin will add a submenu item called "WP Quick Pages" underneath "Pages" section of your admin area. On this age you can quickly enter pages, one per line, like this:

When you're finished click the **Create these pages** button. You will find blank, published pages with these titles now show up in your Pages section.

The cool part is you can quickly show hierarchies as well:

The example is probably pretty obvious, but the parent of the page is dictated by the number of hyphens in front of the title.

If you find yourself working on sites where the structure gets decided upon before the content is necessarily ready (ahem) then you may find this useful.
